In this Project I want to make visualization using java secure package.
Keep in mind this is no the real blockchain, it only for visualization that helps me understand better about the chaining blocks.

There are 3 Classes in the blockchain file.
- Hashing.java : Using java secure package to hash the value
- Block.java : Create a class to made Block objects.
- Blockchain.java : This is the main method, the program utilize ECDSA digital signature and SHA256 for encryption.
